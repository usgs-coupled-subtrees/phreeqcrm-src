model cells, transfer of data to and from the module, and
parallelization by MPI or OpenMP.

If the code is compiled with the preprocessor directive
USE_OPENMP, the reaction module use OPENMP and multiple

directive USE_MPI, the reaction module will use MPI and
multiple processes. If neither preprocessor directive is
used, the reaction module will be serial (unparallelized).

Args:
	nxyz (int): The number of grid cells in the users model. 
	
	thread_count_or_communicator (int): If multithreaded, the
		number of threads to use in parallel segments of the code.

"Returns the units of concentration used by the transport model. Options are 1, 
mg/L;

by the number of moles of each element in the solution. The units of transport 
concentration are used when transport concentrations are converted to solution 
moles by :meth:`SetConcentrations` and :meth:`Concentrations2Utility`. The 
units of solution concentration also are used when solution moles are converted 
to transport concentrations by :meth:`GetConcentrations`.

To convert from mg/L to moles of element in the representative volume of a 
reaction cell, mg/L is converted to mol/L and multiplied by the solution volume,
 which is the product of porosity (:meth:`SetPorosity`), saturation 
(:meth:` SetSaturation`), and representative volume 
(:meth:` SetRepresentativeVolume`). To  convert from mol/L to moles of element 
in a cell , mol/L is multiplied by the solution volume. To convert from mass 
fraction to moles of element in a cell, kg /kgs is converted to mol/kgs, 
multiplied by density (:meth:`SetDensity`) and multiplied by the solution volume.

To convert from moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell
 to mg/L, the number of moles of an element is divided by the solution volume 
resulting in mol/L, and then converted to mg/L. To convert from moles of element
 in the representative volume of a reaction cell to mol/L,  the number of moles 
of an element is divided by the solution volume resulting in mol/L. To convert 
from moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell to mass 
fraction, the number of moles of an element is converted to kg and divided by 
the total mass of the solution. Two options are available for the volume and 
mass of solution that are used in converting to transport concentrations: (1) 
the volume and mass of solution are calculated by PHREEQC, or (2) the volume of 
solution is the product of porosity, saturation, and representative volume, and 
the mass of solution is volume times density as defined by :meth:`SetDensity`. 
Which option is used is determined by :meth:`UseSolutionDensityVolume`.

the workers receive a message (an integer), run a function corresponding to 
that integer, and then wait for another message. SetMpiWorkerCallbackC allows C 
or C++ developers to add another function that responds to additional integer 
messages by calling developer-defined functions corresponding to those 
integers. :meth:`MpiWorker` calls the callback function when the message number 
is not one of the PhreeqcRM message numbers. Messages are unique integer 
numbers. PhreeqcRM uses integers in a range beginning at 0. It is suggested 
that developers use message numbers starting at 1000 or higher for their tasks. 
The callback function calls a developer-defined function specified by the 
message number and then returns to :meth:`MpiWorker` to wait for another 
message.

In C and C++, an additional pointer can be supplied to find the data necessary 
to do the task. A void pointer may be set with :meth:`SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie`. 
This pointer is passed to the callback function through a void pointer 
argument in addition to the integer message argument. The pointer may be to a 
struct or class instance that provides a number of additional pointers to data. 
:meth:`SetMpiWorkerCallbackCookie` must be called by each worker before :meth:`
MpiWorker` is called.

The motivation for this method is to allow the workers to perform other tasks, 
for instance, parallel transport calculations, within the structure of 
:meth:`MpiWorker`. The callback function can be used to allow the workers to 
receive data, perform transport calculations, and (or) send results, without 
leaving the loop of :meth:`MpiWorker`. Alternatively, it is possible for the 
workers to return from :meth:`MpiWorker` by a call to :meth:`MpiWorkerBreak` by

Rates that depend on surface area of solids, are not dependent on the volume of 
water. However, it is important to get the correct surface area for the kinetic 
reaction. To scale the surface area with the number of moles, the specific area

To convert from mg/L to moles of element in the representative volume of a

 which is the product of porosity (:meth:`SetPorosity`), saturation (:meth:`

To convert from moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell
